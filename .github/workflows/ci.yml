# This is the configuration file for our CI via Github Actions.
#
# The result of all executions of the github actions is logged in the "Actions" tab at the top of
# the repository. If the jobs aren't running as they should, check there to see if you didn't
# introduce a syntax error in the YAML file or something like that.
